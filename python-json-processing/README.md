Link: https://www.coursera.org/projects/storing-retrieving-and-processing-json-data-with-python

## Overview
This course consists of a guided project, and you will learn what JSON API is, how to store/ request JSON data in Python, and how to develop a desktop app in Tkinter.

## Notes
- API connects the server to the client.
- Users can acccess API data using a URL.
- To parse the response object to JSON, use `response.json()`
- `.get(url)` is used to create a GET HTTP request in Python.
- JSON objects can be considered as dictionaries in Python.
- TO access the `name` property of JSON object, use `name=obj['name']`
- An instance of a Person object will look like this `p = Person(arg1, arg2,...,)`
- The method is used to resize an image object in Python `image.resize((100,100))`
- In Tkinter, users can prevent root window from being size-adjustable by doing `root.resiable(0,0)`
- In Tkinter, users can use `root.title('title')` to add a title to the root window.
